# 👋 Hi, I’m Roy Williams

## About Me

- 👀 I’m an AI enthusiast turned student engineer, fascinated by the possibilities that Artificial Intelligence brings to the table. I've dabbled in AI through self-directed projects and now, I'm formalizing that passion through a rigorous academic program at the University of Advancing Technologies.

- 🌱 I'm pursing a Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence. My studies encompass a spectrum of AI specialties, from machine learning and behavior simulation to natural language processing and deep learning, based on big data analytics. Beyond the classroom, I've put theory into practice by developing AI applications that inform financial decisions and enhance trading systems.

- 💞️ I'm looking for opportunities to grow and learn by collaborating on projects that not only demand technical AI skills but also creativity and innovation. My hands-on experience has taught me much, yet I am always seeking to learn from those with more to share.

- 📫 How to reach me: To exchange ideas, discuss potential collaborations, or simply chat about the latest in AI, shoot me an email at [investinatech@gmail.com](mailto:your-email@example.com).

## My AI Journey So Far

- Before college, I embarked on a self-taught path, building real-world AI applications. This experience gave me a practical foundation and an appetite for the complexities of AI.

- Now, as a student, I'm delving deeper into AI theories and principles, strengthening my understanding and abilities. I’m particularly proud of the reinforcement learning models and automated systems I've built, which have reinforced my resolve to make AI accessible and beneficial across various domains.

## Seeking Collaborative Growth

- While I've had the chance to apply AI in real-world settings, I'm just scratching the surface. I am on the hunt for projects that offer mutual growth — where I can contribute my knowledge, and in return, gain insights from seasoned experts.

- If you're looking for a fresh perspective or a partner in the AI space who brings enthusiasm and a foundational understanding of AI applications, I'd love to connect.

## Let’s Learn and Innovate Together

- I am poised to blend my self-taught skills and academic learning to contribute to meaningful projects. Whether you're an individual or an organization, if you believe in fostering growth and sharing knowledge, let's team up to innovate and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.
